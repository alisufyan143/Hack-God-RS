# GUI Scientific Calculator

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) scientific calculator implemented in Python using the `Tkinter` library. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific calculations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator Operations:**
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
  - Clear last entry (`C`) and All Clear (`AC`)

- **Scientific Calculator Operations:**
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`
  - Logarithmic functions: `ln` (natural log), `log` (base-10)
  - Factorial: `x!`
  - Square root: `√`
  - Exponentiation: `^`
  - Reciprocal: `1/x`
  - Degree and Radian conversion: `deg`, `rad`
  - Pi (`π`)

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the main code for the calculator application, including both the basic and scientific functionalities.
- **Dependencies**: The project only relies on the built-in Python libraries (`Tkinter` and `math`).

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `Tkinter` (usually pre-installed with Python)
- `math` (built-in library)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
   cd scientific-calculator
2. Run The Command In CLI

   ```bash
   python main.py
